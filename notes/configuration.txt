Camera provides list of Plane & each of them contains Uint8List of bytes representing format YUV_420_888.
ML Kit is using Uint8List of bytes to represent format NV21.
To convert from YUV to NV simply concatenate planes bytes into single list of bytes.

For ML Kit to properly recognize text from camera input proper rotation needs to be provided based on
real device rotation. See method `_pickImageRotation` in file `TextRecognizer.dart`.
To get real device rotation check `text_recognition/preview/bloc.dart` & `NativeDeviceOrientationCommunicator`.

RotatedBox or Transform.rotate cause problems with Text widget, there where undesired shift matching width
or height of the Text widget depending on rotation & that's why for now idea of recognized text places as
overlay over original one is ditched.
